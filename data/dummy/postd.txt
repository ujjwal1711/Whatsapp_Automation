In the 2013 Delhi Legislative Assembly election, they challenge the Congress Party and the BJP, India’s oldest and most powerful political establishments, using grassroots strategies to engage voters. All the while they grapple with the realities of politics while struggling keeping their idealism alive.\n\nWATCH NEXT: \nHow Two First-Time Directors Made a Radical Documentary on Indian Politics - https://vice.video/2BAmOie\n\nClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE\n\nCheck out our full video catalog: http://bit.ly/VICE-Videos\nVideos, daily editorial and more: http://vice.com\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo\nLike VICE on Facebook: http://fb.com/vice\nFollow VICE on Twitter: http://twitter.com/vice\nRead our Tumblr: http://vicemag.tumblr.com\nFollow us on Instagram: http://instagram.com/vice\nCheck out our Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/vicemag\nDownload VICE on iOS: http://apple.co/28Vgmqz\nDownload VICE on Android: http://bit.ly/28S8Et0","author_name":"VICE\n    \n    \n      \n        \n        \n      \n    \n    \n  \n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n      Verified","posted_date":"","likes":408,"un_likes":0,"comments":408,"share":408,"url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/inR_O_2Apm0&t=218s"},
